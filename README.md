# CMOS Inverter using Microwind
This is my little project about creating CMOS Inverter using Microwind tool. And this will be my first step towards the microwind tool.
WHile creating the CMOS Inverter in microwind, I came to know about icons and what each does while drawing the layout diagram.
I also learned that P-mos transistor cannot be placed on P-substrate so, it requires n-well and +Vdd.
Finally, I ran the simulation and received the Voltage vs Time graph. In the output, I could observe that the ouput is 180 degree phase shifted with respect to input.
